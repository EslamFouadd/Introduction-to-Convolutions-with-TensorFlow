# Introduction-to-Convolutions-with-TensorFlow

A convolution is a filter that passes over an image, processes it, and extracts features that show a commonality in the image. In this lab you explore convolution filters. You learn what they are and how they work by processing an image to extract features from it! You also explore pooling, which compresses your image and further emphasizes the features.
